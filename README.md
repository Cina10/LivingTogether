# Detailed Product Spec

# LivingTogether
#### Description
The purpose of this app is to act as a communal living messaging board. It has the benefits of a tool like Splitwise, but expands beyond monetary spending to include things like a communal chore list, shower scheduler, reminders about cleaning something, and a live shopping list. 

#### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Personal Organizer App
- **Mobile:** The mobile feature is important as it is all about live daily communication with your roommates/apartment mates. 
- **Story:** It's meant to streamline the process of constantly texting to see if anyone needs anything when you are heading to the grocery store, calculating how money should be split for appliances and food, eliminate confusion over shower times, and eliminate the need to create chore spreadsheets. 
- **Market:** Any young person in a communal living arrangement
- **Habit:** People frequently update when they go shopping etc. Would send alerts when other people are heading to the store, or sending reminders, shower schduele is changed (alerts can be turned on and off)
- **Scope:** A minimal version would basically be a group posting wall, similar to a facebook group, that can be edited by the group, but it could be scaled up to make it more all inclusive of all you might need in a communal living situation.
